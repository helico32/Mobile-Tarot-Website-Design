  # An AI project
  As AI is taking more space online I wanted to showcase my abilities using it. This project is a mobile first website about tarot using Emmanuel Iger intrepretations. Currently available only in French.

  # Workflow
  - Claude generated a full UX research
  - I went to ask Loveart for 3 frames for a UI designer. Landing page, selecting cards, result page.
  - Then I provided Figma Make with the design system and ask it to create the rest of the app.
  - I create 2 tarot decks (a minimalistic one with Figma Make and a Mucha inspirated one with Reve)
  - I checked out the code on VSC ( it needs classes and simplification )
  - Claude and I are making the changes in the code right now.
